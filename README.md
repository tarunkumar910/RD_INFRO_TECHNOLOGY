## 📝 Task Details  

### 🔹 Simple Task: Password Management  
**Objective:**  
To create a simple Python-based password manager that allows users to:
- Create new passwords.
- Delete stored passwords.
- Check stored passwords securely.

**Skills Applied:**  
- Python programming  
- File handling for storage of passwords  
- Basic encryption techniques (e.g., using `cryptography` or `hashlib`)

**Technologies Used:**  
- Python 3  
- JSON (for storing password data)  
- `cryptography` or `hashlib` (for password encryption)

**Task Features:**  
1. **Create a New Password**:  
   The user can generate and store new passwords securely.  
2. **Delete a Stored Password**:  
   Allows users to remove passwords they no longer need from the manager.  
3. **Check Existing Passwords**:  
   Users can view their saved passwords (decrypted).  

#### **Demo Video:**

### 🔹 Advanced Task (Report-Based): Phishing Email Detection  
**Objective:**  
To research and compile a detailed report on identifying phishing emails and implementing strategies to mitigate such attacks.  

**Skills Applied:**  
- Cybersecurity research  
- Data analysis of phishing email patterns  
- Report writing and presentation  

**Report Highlights:**  
- **Definition and Indicators**: Characteristics of phishing emails, including suspicious links, spoofed sender information, and urgent language.  
- **Detection Techniques**: Discussed AI/ML models, email header analysis, and anti-phishing tools.  
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Proposed end-user training, email filtering, and threat intelligence systems.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements  

1. Extend the **Password Management** with a password breach check using an API.  
2. Upgrade the **Packet Sniffer Tool** to log suspicious packets in real-time.  
3. Convert the **Phishing Detection Report** into a hands-on project using a machine learning-based detection tool.

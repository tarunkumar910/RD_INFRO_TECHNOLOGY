# RD INFRO TECHNOLOGY Internship Projects  

## üõ°Ô∏è Overview  

This repository contains the tasks I completed during my **4-week Cybersecurity Internship** at **RD INFRO TECHNOLOGY**. The internship allowed me to work on real-world cybersecurity problems and enhance my technical and problem-solving skills.  

The tasks are divided into **three levels**:  
1. **Simple**  
2. **Intermediate**  
3. **Advanced (Report-Based)**

## üìù Task Details  

### üîπ Simple Task: Password Management  
**Objective:**  
To create a simple Python-based password manager that allows users to:
- Create new passwords.
- Delete stored passwords.
- Check stored passwords securely.

**Skills Applied:**  
- Python programming  
- File handling for storage of passwords  


**Technologies Used:**  
- Python 3  
- JSON (for storing password data)  


**Task Features:**  
1. **Create a New Password**:  
   The user can generate and store new passwords securely.  
2. **Delete a Stored Password**:  
   Allows users to remove passwords they no longer need from the manager.  
3. **Check Existing Passwords**:  
   Users can view their saved passwords (decrypted).  

#### **Demo Video:**  
You can view the demo video of the password manager in action here:

### üîπ Intermediate Task: Phishing Awareness  
**Objective:**  
Conducted a simulated phishing campaign and provided training on identifying phishing emails. This task is divided into two parts:

1. **Phishing Campaign**:  
   Conducted a simulated phishing campaign to test how well the targeted individuals could identify phishing emails.
   
   **Campaign Report:**  
   You can view the detailed report on the simulated phishing campaign here:
